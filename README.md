# UDP Guess the Number Game (C++ using Winsock)

This is a simple **"Guess the Number" game** implemented in **C++ using UDP sockets (Winsock)**. It demonstrates client-server communication over the **User Datagram Protocol**, where the client tries to guess a secret number generated by the server.

---

## Features

- Random number guessing game
- UDP-based communication using Winsock
- Real-time hint feedback: `HIGHER`, `LOWER`, `CORRECT`
- Automatic game restart on correct guess
- Works on Windows using standard C++ and Winsock2

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Windows OS
- C++ Compiler (MinGW g++, MSVC, or Code::Blocks)
- Winsock2 (part of Windows SDK)
- Git (optional, for source control)

## How to Run
Step 1: Run the Server
Open a terminal and run: server.exe

You will see:
UDP Server started on port 8080
Secret number is: XX

Step 2: Run the Client
Open another terminal and run: client.exe
Now start guessing the number!

## Game Logic
Server generates a secret number between 1 and 100

Client sends guesses via UDP

Server responds with:

HIGHER → if guess is too low

LOWER → if guess is too high

CORRECT! → if the number is guessed

Server restarts the game after a correct guess
